## Linear Regression

![Linear](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)
We chose Linear Regression because we are familiar with it. Using the first point and last point we 
find the gradient 
Gradient=(y1 - y0)/(x1 - x0)
        =(2  - 0) / (2016 - 1956)
        = 1 / 30
        
y = m x + c
y = 1/30 x
